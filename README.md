This API allows users to subscribe to actions created by their favorite eSports players, teams, and games.  They recieve notfications in IM services that they register with their accounts.

Additionally, users can add their gaming accouts so actions generated by them in games can be subscribed to by marketers, or game companies interested in keeping their players engaged.  

Future APIs will allow these companies to add keyword based responses that can be used by Gamebots to provide contextual help to players challenged or stuck in games they are playing.
